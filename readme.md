# Chopper Game Repository

Project of building a chopper-like game using HTML and JavaScript (jQuery).

Things I learned in this project:

- jQuerry is awesome

jQuerry is a library that makes the use of JavaScript even easier and add tons of new functions to it.

- Creating a (web) game is fun

Although it's indeed very challenging, creating a game is a good experience, and having the feeling of accomplishment when seeing functions working made the time spent on it really worth it.

- Be careful when declaring const variables

I had some issues because instead of declaring `var` or `let` variables I decided to use `const` some times. Thanks console for saving me :relieved:
